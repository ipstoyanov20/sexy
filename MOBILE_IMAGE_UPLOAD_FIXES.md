# Mobile Image Upload Fixes

## Problem
On mobile devices, when users upload images and press the "Качи" (Upload) button, the images don't display properly in the gallery - they just show the alt text instead of the actual image. This indicates that the images are failing to load.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Data URL Size Limits**: Mobile browsers have stricter limits on data URL sizes compared to desktop browsers
2. **Canvas Memory Issues**: Mobile devices have limited memory for canvas operations
3. **Image Processing Errors**: The image processing function was not optimized for mobile constraints
4. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Limited error handling for mobile-specific issues

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Image Processing for Mobile (`processImageForMobile`)
- **Reduced maximum dimensions**: Changed from 1200px to 800px for better mobile compatibility
- **Added memory constraints**: Limited canvas size to 1MP (1,000,000 pixels) for mobile devices
- **Implemented progressive compression**: Tries multiple quality levels (0.7, 0.6, 0.5, etc.) until size is acceptable
- **Stricter size limits**: Reduced data URL limit from 8MB to 4MB for mobile browsers
- **Added timeout handling**: 30-second timeout to prevent hanging on mobile devices
- **Better error handling**: More specific error messages for different failure scenarios

### 2. Improved File Upload Validation (`handleImageUpload`)
- **Mobile detection**: Automatically detects mobile devices using user agent and screen width
- **Stricter file size limits**: 3MB for mobile vs 5MB for desktop
- **Enhanced format validation**: Only allows JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats
- **Memory warnings**: Logs warnings for large files on mobile devices

### 3. Enhanced Database Operations (`saveImageToDatabase`)
- **Improved retry logic**: Better exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 6s delays)
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed console logs for debugging
- **Better validation**: Validates that data is actually returned from database insert
- **Specific error messages**: Mobile-friendly error messages for different failure types

### 4. Robust Gallery Display
- **Lazy loading**: Added `loading="lazy"` attribute for better performance
- **Better error handling**: Improved error state display when images fail to load
- **Data validation**: Validates image data when loading from database
- **Conditional rendering**: Only renders img tag if valid src is available

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Mobile-specific error messages**: Context-aware error messages for mobile users
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed console logs for debugging issues
- **Graceful degradation**: Shows placeholder when images fail to load
- **User-friendly feedback**: Clear Bulgarian error messages

## Key Improvements

### Before:
- Images processed at up to 1200px dimensions
- 8MB data URL limit
- Basic error handling
- No mobile-specific optimizations

### After:
- Images processed at up to 800px dimensions on mobile
- 4MB data URL limit for mobile browsers
- Progressive compression with quality adjustment
- Mobile device detection and optimization
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Better user feedback

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test on various mobile devices (Android, iOS)
2. Test with different image sizes and formats
3. Test with poor network conditions
4. Test with large images that require compression
5. Verify error messages are user-friendly

## Performance Benefits
- Reduced memory usage on mobile devices
- Faster upload times due to smaller file sizes
- Better reliability on mobile networks
- Improved user experience with clear error messages

## Technical Details
- Canvas operations are optimized for mobile memory constraints
- Data URLs are validated before storage and display
- Retry logic handles mobile network instability
- Progressive image compression ensures compatibility across devices
